			<b>Hey there, I'm Ankur! </b>
			For the past few months, I've been building projects on the Ancestry team at <a href="http://23andme.com">23andMe</a>!
			Right now, I'm working on improving people's understanding of their ancestry, health, and genetic heritage.

			I grew up in Libertyville, Illinois, eventually made my way to LA, and graduated
			in 2019 from USC with a degree in Computer Science. While there, I worked in the <a href="http://kuhn.usc.edu">Kuhn-Hicks lab</a>,
			where I worked on models to forecast the progression of metastatic breast and lung cancers to give oncologists
			better insights into how to treat their patients.
			<br> <br>

			I co-founded one of LA's first summer technology fellowship programs, <a href="http://tech.la">Tech.LA Fellows</a>,
			which partners students across the nation with some of the best startups in the city. I also spent a lot of time
			focused on <a href="http://sparksc.org">Spark SC</a>, USCâ€™s student-driven hub for entrepreneurship and innovation,
			where I've run <a href="https://sparksc.org/initiatives/startup-career-fair/"> startup career fairs with 4000+
			total attendees</a>, helped organize <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1000PitchesUSC/">two-month pitch
			contests</a>, and hosted <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sparkxm/the-thiel-fellow-series-episode-1">a podcast
			about student entrepreneurship</a>.
			<br><br>

			Aside from those things, I love longboarding, running, <a href="https://twitter.com/Truchet_Nested">truchet
			patterns</a>, and cooking for friends and family.
