			<p id="about"><b>Hey there, I'm Ankur! </b> For the past few months, I've been working on projects on the Ancestry team at 23andMe! I'm excited about healthcare technology, genetics, and machine learning. Right now, I'm focused on working on meaningful projects that will improve people's understanding of their health, wellness, and genetic heritage.

			Born and raised in Libertyville, Illinois, I just graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in Computer Science. While there, I worked in the <a href="http://kuhn.usc.edu">Kuhn-Hicks lab</a>, where I spent time building new models to forecast the progression of metastatic breast and lung cancers to give oncologists better insights into how to treat their patients. 
			<br> <br>	
			I also co-founded a summer startup internship program in Los Angeles called <a href="http://tech.la">Tech.LA Fellows</a>, which partners students across the nation with some of the best startups in the city! <br> <br>

			I spent a lot of time focused on <a href="http://sparksc.org">Spark SC</a>, USC’s student-driven hub for entrepreneurship and innovation, where I've run<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/435097373560937/"> startup career fairs</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1000PitchesUSC/">two-month pitch contests</a>, and hosted <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sparkxm/the-thiel-fellow-series-episode-1">a podcast about student entrepreneurship</a>.

			Aside from those things, I love longboarding, reading, and cooking for friends and family.
