			<p id="about"><b>Hey there, I'm Ankur! </b> For the past few months, I've building projects on the Ancestry team at <a href="http://23andme.com">23andMe</a>! Right now, I'm working on improving people's understanding of their health, wellness, and genetic heritage.

			Born and raised in Libertyville, Illinois, I just graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in Computer Science. While there, I worked in the <a href="http://kuhn.usc.edu">Kuhn-Hicks lab</a>, where I spent time working on models to forecast the progression of metastatic breast and lung cancers to give oncologists better insights into how to treat their patients. 
			<br> <br>	
			I also co-founded one of LA's first summer technology programs, <a href="http://tech.la">Tech.LA Fellows</a>, which partners students across the nation with some of the best startups in the city! <br> <br>

			I spent a lot of time focused on <a href="http://sparksc.org">Spark SC</a>, USCâ€™s student-driven hub for entrepreneurship and innovation, where I've run <a href="https://sparksc.org/initiatives/startup-career-fair/"> startup career fairs with 1000+ attendees</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1000PitchesUSC/">two-month pitch contests</a>, and hosted <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sparkxm/the-thiel-fellow-series-episode-1">a podcast about student entrepreneurship</a>.

			Aside from those things, I love longboarding, running, and <a href="https://eatwithpeople.website/">cooking for friends and family</a>.
