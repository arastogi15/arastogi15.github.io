			<p id="about"><b>Hey there, I'm Ankur! </b> Born and raised in Libertyville, Illinois, I'm working towards undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California. I'm currently doing research in the <a href="http://kuhn.usc.edu">Kuhn-Hicks lab</a>, where I'm building new models to forecast the progression of metastatic breast and lung cancers to give oncologists better insights into how to treat their patients. 
			<br> <br>	
			I also co-founded a summer startup internship program here in Los Angeles called <a href="http://tech.la">Tech.LA Fellows</a>, which partners students across the nation with some of the best startups in the city! <br> <br>

			I’m also involved with <a href="http://sparksc.org">Spark SC</a>, USC’s student-driven hub for entrepreneurship and innovation, where I've run<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/435097373560937/"> startup career fairs</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1000PitchesUSC/">two-month pitch contests</a>, and hosted <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sparkxm/the-thiel-fellow-series-episode-1">a podcast about student entrepreneurship</a>.

			Aside from those things, I'm an avid hiker, reader, and baker-of-breads!
