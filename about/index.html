			<p id="about"><b>Hey there, I'm Ankur! </b> I was born in raised in Libertyville, Illinois, and am working towards my undegraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I'm an avid hiker, reader, and baker-of-cakes. I'm currently doing research in the Kuhn-Hicks lab, where I'm working on building new models to forecast the progression of breast and lung cancers to give oncologists better insights into how to treat their patients. I also co-founded a summer startup internship program here in Los Angeles called <a href="http://tech.la">Tech.LA Fellows</a>, which partners students across the nation with some of the best startups in the city! <br> <br>

			I’m also involved with <a href="sparksc.org">Spark SC</a>, USC’s student-driven hub for entrepreneurship and innovation, where I've run<a href="http://startupcareerfair.sparksc.org/"> startup career fairs</a>, <a href="http://1000pitches.sparksc.org/">two-month pitch contests</a>, and collaborated with a small team of students to build <a href="http://uniteconf.org/">a national collegiate entreneurship conference</a>. I'm lighthearted, curious and always up for a challenge.
