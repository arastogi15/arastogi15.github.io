	<p><b>Hey there, I'm Ankur! (It's pronounced like "bunker" without the 'b'.) I was born in raised in Libertyville, Illinois, and am working on my undegraduate degre at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I'm an avid hiker, reader, and baker-of-cakes. At USC, I’m involved with Spark SC, USC’s student-driven hub for entrepreneurship and innovation, HackSC, USC’s largest annual hackathon, and research with the Laboratory of Neural Computation, where I’m working on modeling Hopfield networks and exploring their capacity limitations. I'm lighthearted, curious, and always up for a challenge.
